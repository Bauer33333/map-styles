# Open Historical Map Styles
This repository contains. vector map styles that can be applied to OHM vector tiles. 

The tile source is https://vtiles.openhistoricalmap.org/, and the internals of how those are created you'll find over at https://github.com/Open-Historical-Map-Labs/openhistoricaltiles.

Here, you can save your worries about tile servers and data updates and instead just load a JSON file into https://maputnik.github.io/ and make some updates!

Note that changes here do not publish automagically to the OHM website. the vector tiles on the AWS staging site are stored as Javascript over at https://github.com/Open-Historical-Map-Labs/ohm-website/blob/ohm-mapbox-gl-style/app/assets/javascripts/ohm.style.js
